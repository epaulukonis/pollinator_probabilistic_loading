This repository contains all scripts for work related to non-Apis pollinator risk assessment research conducted during my ORISE Research fellowship with US EPA. 
All code is in beta, and currently being leveraged for publication of results. 
The work here does not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of the US EPA.
